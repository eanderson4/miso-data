Todo:
Work on statistics to make yearly calculations
-Create new table with year to store each calculation
-Scrape DB for info, make calculations, insert into new table


Problems:
filldb_single.py
I noticed an error in year 2007 (2/11 maybe) in the data loading routine that needs to be looked into, so most likely missing at least one day of data for that year
